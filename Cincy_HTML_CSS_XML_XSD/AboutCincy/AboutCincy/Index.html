        <h4>About the city:</h4>
        <p>
            Cincinnati is a major city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the government seat of <em>Hamilton County</em>. Settled in 1788, the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers.
            As Cincinnati was the first city founded after the American Revolution, as well as the first major inland city in the country, it is regarded as the first purely "American" city.
            Cincinnati has many nicknames, including <em>Cincy, "The Queen City," "The Queen of the West," "The Blue Chip City,"</em> and <em>"The City of Seven Hills,"</em> These are more typically associated with professional, academic, and public relations references to the city, including restaurant names such as Blue Chip Cookies, and are not commonly used by locals in casual conversation.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Demographics:</h4>
        <p>
            In 1950, Cincinnati reached its peak population of over 503,000 residents, but has been losing population in every census count since that time. In the late 20th century industrial restructuring caused a loss of jobs. According to the Census Bureau's 2006 estimates, the population was 332,252, representing a small increase from 331,310 in 2005.
